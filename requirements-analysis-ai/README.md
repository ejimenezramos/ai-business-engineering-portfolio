# AI Requirements Analysis

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs)
can be applied to a common real-world scenario in software engineering and consulting:
translating business requirements into actionable technical work.

The application takes business requirements written in natural language and analyzes
them to extract structured technical information.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to show how AI can support technical professionals
in bridging the gap between business and engineering by automatically identifying:

- Technical tasks
- Rough effort estimations
- Potential risks and ambiguities
- Areas that require further clarification

This reflects typical activities performed during requirements analysis, solution design
and technical consulting.
